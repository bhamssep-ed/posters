## Poster Text
Gibor Basri’s research focusses on the physics of stars. From magnetic activity to star formation, he has made significant contributions to our understanding of stellar evolution. <sup>[1]</sup>
  
Gibor was initially drawn to Caltech when applying to University, but turned down his acceptance offer when he realised that they were not accepting women. Instead he went on to study at Stanford. <sup>[2]</sup>
  
Gibor developed a test to aid astrophysicists in locating a class of object known as a brown dwarf. These are more massive than planets, but not quite massive enough to fuse hydrogen like a star. <sup>[3]</sup>
  
Gibor takes an active role in promoting equality and diversity. In his role as a professor at Berkeley he became the campus’ first Vice Chancellor for Equity and Inclusion. <sup>[4]</sup>
