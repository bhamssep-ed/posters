On the 10th of June 2020, amid the global Black Lives Matter protests, a day of strike was declared in STEM. The #ShutDownSTEM strike was a day for people in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics to talk and reflect on the lack of diversity in our fields; nowhere is this lack of diversity more apparent than in Physics & Astronomy.

During that first day of strike we met within our small research group (Sun, Stars and Exoplanets) to voice some uncomfortable questions. What stops black students from choosing a degree in Physics? Why is the proportion of black students continuing into postgraduate studies in Physics & Astronomy so low compared to white students? What is putting these students off?

The reality is that systemic racism in its many forms is still prevalent throughout science, often pushing the most promising students out of the field. Black students often report struggling to see themselves as a scientist, and may never have considered it a space for them in the first place.

Alongside extra outreach work, the group wanted to start making changes in our own spaces to address these issues. Although the representation of astrophysicists from the BAME community is often lacking in the public conscience, many successful scientists have been overlooked. With this in mind, we developed a set of posters to highlight a small percentage of the individuals that we want to share.
