This website is still a work in progress. Preview it live [here](https://bhamssep-ed.github.io/posters).

## Contributing

Pick a person and edit their file under the `_people` directory. You can
edit directly on GitHub or make a Pull Request if you are familiar with that
workflow. GitHub lets you preview the page before committing your changes. Please check this before submitting a change.

The files are in Markdown format. Most content can be written as plain text.
There is some syntax which helps format the content. Section headings should be
written like so,

```markdown
## Section 1

Content for section 1 goes here...

## Section 2

Content for section 2 goes here...
```

and links to external resources can be written like so,

```markdown
[text to be linked](https://www.example.com)
```

Text can be made italic and bold,

```markdown
*italic text*
**bold text**
```

and bullet points can be written like so,

```markdown
- Using a hyphen
* Or using an asterisk
```

These will then be formatted appropriately given the website theme.
